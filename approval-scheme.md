As all members of the **GRIN community council**  all have owner roles on this repository,  I suggest the following rules for approvals of pull-requests(PR):

**Repository**|  Required members of CC for PR |  notes      
:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
[agenda](https://github.com/grincc/agenda) | 1 |  CC meeting notes, etc
[security](https://github.com/grincc/security) | 4 | signing, verifying
[finance](https://github.com/grincc/finance) | 4 | public CC fund documentation
[docs](https://github.com/grincc/docs) | 2 | CC related documents 

otherwise anyone of us could approve something without the consent of the other members. 
The CC member who submits the PR is included in the count of required members to aproave PR's.

**CC** = GRIN community council 
**PR** = pull request
