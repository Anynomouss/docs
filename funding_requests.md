### Document pending approval
## Summary
In this document we outline the procedure and protocol of handling funding requests. 
This document serves as a guideline and reference point for both Funding Requests applicants and the community and council that has to judge and approve these requests.
Funding Requests can only be granted upon discussion and an official vote to approve the request in a Grin Community Council meeting (biweekly meetings in Grin #General on Keybase).

## Funding
Funding request can be made in any currency. However, for the ease of discussing we prefer requests are made in major currencies like euros or dollars.
We advise to make a funding request in the following format:

- a) Total amount of funding to be paid upon completion of the project
- b) Total amount of funding, sub payments to be made upon completion of predefined milestones
- c) Any other funding model if the applicant can provide good arguments to deviate from option a) and b)

## Payments
Payments will be made after reviewing the completed project or completed project milestones.
Payments will by default be made 85% in BTC and 20% (15% base + 5% bonus) in Grin. 
This effectively means applicants will be paid 105% of the amount they requested if they applicant choses to be paid in 15% or more in Grin.
Payment in Grin will be based on a monthly average value while Bitcoin  
In case an applicant prefers to be paid less than the default 15% +5% bonus payment in Grin, we expect sound argumentation why this deviation is required, such as personal circumstances.

## Motivation
As Grin Community Council we want to stimulate adoption of Grin and day to day use by community members and developers alike.
There is a general agreement in the community that Grin should be used in day-to-day life and as such that it would be desirable to use Grin in paying funding requests. 
There are however different opinions on the speed at which Grin's adoption should be pushed as well as practical objections such as the fact that developers could incur additional costs if they require conversion of Grin -> BTC -> fiat currency to meet their daily costs. To compensate developers for any possible losses due to conversions, and to incentives them to use Grin and immerse themselves in the grin ecosystem we decided to introduce the 5% bonus payment in Grin.
Over time as liquidity of Grin increases and more options to easily buy and sell Grin will emerge, the base percentage of 15% payment in Grin required to be eligible for this bonus can be increased.
