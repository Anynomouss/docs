### Document pending approval
## Summary
In this document we outline the procedure and protocol of handeling funding requests. 
This document serves as a guideline and reference point for both Funding Requests applicants and the community and council that has to approve these requests.
Funding Requests can only be granted upon dicussion and an official vote to approve the request in an a Grin Community Council meeting (biweekly meetings in Grin #General on Keybase).

## Funding
Funding request can be made in any currency. However, for the ease of discussing we prefer requests are made in major currencies like euro's or dollars.
We advice to make a funding requests in the following format:

- a) Total amount of funding to be paid upon completion of the project
- b) Total amount of funding, paid upon completion of predefined milestones
- c) Any other funding model as long as the applicant can provide good arguments to deviate from option a) and b)

## Payments
Payments will be made after reviewing the completed project or completed project milestones.
Payments will by default be made 85% in BTC and 20% (15% base + 5% bonus) in Grin. 
This effectively means applicants will be paid 105% of the amount they requested as long as they applicant choses to be paid minmum of 15% payment in Grin. 
The reasoning to chose for this system are:
- As Grin Community Council we will stimulate adoption 
This base percentage of 15% payment in Grin will be increased over the years to come as the Grin ecosystem matures.
