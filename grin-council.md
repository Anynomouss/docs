## Background

Since its launch in 2019, Grin development was funded only by donations. Funds donated to the [Grin General Fund](https://grin.mw/fund) were controlled by the _Original Grin Council_ according to [Grin Governance RFC](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/blob/master/text/0002-grin-governance.md). After the last planned hard fork, this RFC has been replaced with [Simplify-Governance RFC](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/blob/master/text/0016-simplify-governance.md). Meanwhile the Grin community has raised its voice for supporting of more projects extendeding grin and its usability which was heard by the _Original Grin Council_. One of Original Grin Council members, yeastplume made a [proposition](https://gist.github.com/yeastplume/5d1913c7dc40c40f409ffcfe8fa9b094) to split _Grin Development Fund_, and give control to a second group (or more than one group) for decentralizing governance. After discussions of several different split strategies in governance meetings[²](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-pm/blob/master/notes/20210216-meeting-governance.md) [³](https://github.com/newjack777/grin-pm/blob/master/notes/20210302-meeting-governance.md) and [community](https://forum.grin.mw/t/call-for-grin-community-candidates-for-additional-fund-granting-control/8521), it was decided to split Development Fund into two funds: 
1) Grin Development Fund to support core grin development  
2) Grin Community Fund to support community projects

Four community members with a strong proven record who were trust by the community and the Original Council alike, were invited to to join the Community Council: (_dtavarez_, _hendi_, _mcmmike_, _paouky_) were [approved](https://forum.grin.mw/t/call-for-grin-community-candidates-for-additional-fund-granting-control/8521/3?u=stakerv) by original Council. To allow more community participation two additional council members (_anynomous_, _future3000_) were selected only by [votes](https://forum.grin.mw/t/call-for-grin-community-candidates-for-additional-fund-granting-control/8521/13?u=stakerv) of the community. On June 22, the first [community council meeting](https://github.com/grincc/agenda/blob/main/notes/22-06-2021-council-meeting-notes.md) was held. At Septemper 20th, the Grin community Fund [received](https://forum.grin.mw/t/grin-community-council-cc-received-funds-of-33-btc-lets-get-to-work/9247) __33 BTC__ from original Grin Development Fund, by which splitting of funds had been realized. 


## Grin Community Fund

The Grin Community fund is initially seeded by splitting a portion of the Grin Development Fund. In order to keep independence, community fund solely relies on community donations. If you want to keep Grin growing, please consider donating to [Grin Community Fund](https://github.com/grincc/finance/blob/main/addresses.md). 


## Community Meetings

The Grin Community Council gathers every 1st and 3th Tuesday of the month  with a predefined agenda in [Keybase#general channel](https://keybase.io/team/grincoin). Everyone is free to suggest agenda topics before the meetings, join the meetings and express their opinions and ideas in a friendly and respectful environment. Previous meetings notes can be found [here](https://github.com/grincc/agenda/tree/main/notes). You can follow next meetings agenda in community council agenda [repo](https://github.com/grincc/agenda/issues).

## Obligations of Grin Community Council members

Grin Community Councilm members are primarily representatives of the community and are keyholders of the communit funds. They are expected to responsibly manage the keys of the community fund wallets and manage Funding Requests and Bounties in accordance with the [spending guidelines](https://github.com/grincc/docs/blob/Anynomouss-patch-2/spending-guidelines.md). Although preferred, being an active community member is not a requirement. If a council member cannot participate in the councils activities for a prolonged time, he or she is requested to consider stepping down if more suitable representatives are available. Decision making on funding request as well as defining, checking and reviewing deliverables is a community effort.
