## Background

Since its launch in 2019, Grin development was funded by only donations. Donations to [Grin General Fund](https://grin.mw/fund) was controlled by _Original Grin Council_ according to [Grin Governance RFC](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/blob/master/text/0002-grin-governance.md). After the last planned hard fork, this RFC has been replaced with [Simplify-Governance RFC](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-rfcs/blob/master/text/0016-simplify-governance.md). Meanwhile community has raised its voice for supporting of more projects extendeding grin and its usability which was heard by _Original Grin Council_. One of Original Grin Council members, yeastplume made a [proposition](https://gist.github.com/yeastplume/5d1913c7dc40c40f409ffcfe8fa9b094) to split _Grin Development Fund_, and give control to a second group (or more than one group) for decentralizing governance. After discussions of several different split strategies in governance meetings[²](https://github.com/mimblewimble/grin-pm/blob/master/notes/20210216-meeting-governance.md) [³](https://github.com/newjack777/grin-pm/blob/master/notes/20210302-meeting-governance.md) and [community](https://forum.grin.mw/t/call-for-grin-community-candidates-for-additional-fund-granting-control/8521), it was decided to split Development Fund into two funds: 
1) Grin Development Fund to support core grin development  
2) Grin Community Fund to support community projects

Community Council candidates are called for joining to council, among four of them (_dtavarez_, _hendi_, _mcmmike_, _paouky_) were [approved](https://forum.grin.mw/t/call-for-grin-community-candidates-for-additional-fund-granting-control/8521/3?u=stakerv) by original Council. To allow more community participation two additional council members (_anynomous_, _future3000_) are selected only by [votes](https://forum.grin.mw/t/call-for-grin-community-candidates-for-additional-fund-granting-control/8521/13?u=stakerv) of the community. In June 22, the first [community council meeting](https://github.com/grincc/agenda/blob/main/notes/22-06-2021-council-meeting-notes.md) held. In Septemper 20, Grin community Fund [received](https://forum.grin.mw/t/grin-community-council-cc-received-funds-of-33-btc-lets-get-to-work/9247) __33 BTC__ from original Grin Development Fund, by which splitting of funds has been realized. 


## Grin Community Fund

Grin Community fund is initially seeded by splitting a portion of Grin Development Fund. In order to keep independence, community fund solely relies on community donations. If you want to keep Grin growing, please consider donation to [Grin Community Fund](https://github.com/grincc/finance/blob/main/addresses.md).
