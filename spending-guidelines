## Summary

This document is meant be to used as base guidelines for spending the Grin Community Council Fund, which uses are appropriate and which are not.

## Motivation

Recently, the Grin Community Council was formed with community members with a deep interest in helping Grin grow. Since the Grin Community Council manages funds, it is necessary to have a transparent list of appropriate uses.

## Community-level explanation

### Appropriate use of the Funds

Funds should be invested solely on activities related to Grin, without exceptions.

- Research and Development in areas related to Grin or Mimblewimble in general  
- Fully open-sourced, community-based projects that enhance the Grin ecosystem
- Supporting non-profit, community-driven and inclusive promotional efforts for the Grin Community
- Supporting events and/or activities specificly related to Grin (i.e. conferences)
- Projects and/or Ideas oriented to strengthen and/or secure Grin

### Inappropriate use of Funds

Invest on any action that can harm Grin as a Project are forbidden, also any effort that could lead to a Grin fork is out of the scope completely.

### Decision Process

The discussions regarding spending the funds should always be public via an open pre-announced channel and every community member is invited to participate. The Community Council will never make a decision without having clear:

- To whom the funds will be transferred.
- How will the expense be helpful for Grin.
- How much funds will be spent.
- Will the expense be a one time expense or will it require several expenses?

Some rules will be established during the discussions to clarify how the accountability process will be.

### Reporting

The result of all funding decisions will be published in the meeting notes found in the [Grin Community Fund](https://github.com/grincc/docs) repository. It is mandatory to publish a detailed spending log of all transactions made in and out of the funds.
