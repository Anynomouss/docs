## Summary

This document is meant be to used as base guidelines for spending the Grin Community Council Fund, stating which uses are appropriate and which are not.

## Motivation

Recently, the Grin Community Council was formed with community members with a deep interest in helping Grin grow. Since the Grin Community Council manages funds, it is necessary to have a transparent list of appropriate uses.

## Community-level explanation

### Appropriate use of the Funds

Funds should be invested solely on activities related to Grin, without exceptions.

- Research and Development in areas related to Grin or Mimblewimble in general  
- Fully open-sourced, community-based projects that enhance the Grin ecosystem
- Supporting non-profit, community-driven and inclusive promotional efforts for the Grin Community
- Supporting events and/or activities specificly related to Grin (i.e. conferences)
- Projects and/or Ideas oriented to strengthen and/or secure Grin

### Inappropriate use of Funds

Financing actions that can harm Grin as a Project is forbidden. A formal list of harmful actions listed below

1. Financing projects incompatible with current RFC, as they could lead to a fork.
2. Funding art which is vulgar and explicitly offends a person or a group of people.
3. Covering the expenses of resources for illegal purposes, such as causing DDoS attack of someone's service for example.
4. Investing money in physical or digital assets.

### Decision Process

The discussions regarding spending the funds should always be public on an open pre-announced channel and every community member is invited to participate in these discussions. The Community Council will never make a decision without having clear:

1. To whom the funds will be transferred.
2. How the expense will be helpful for Grin.
3. How much funds will be spent.
4. If the expense will be a one time or require multiple rounds of financing?

Some rules will be established during the discussions to clarify how the accountability process will be.

The Grin Community Council will provide response to the request within X days (until the nearest meeting) which will contain one of the following

- Approval
- Denial accompagned with formal reason and decision if re-application would be accepted, and if, guidelines what should be changed
- Request for decision deadline extension for another X days (until nearest meeting) along with justification why deadline is required
- Request for further details, accompanied by a list of questions.

### Reporting

The result of all funding decisions will be published in the meeting notes found in the [Grin Community Fund](https://github.com/grincc/docs) repository. It is mandatory to publish a detailed spending log of all transactions made in and out of the funds.
